# sampling-DPPs-with-Clifford-loaders
We provide here notebooks relying on IBM Qiskit project associated with the manuscript 

[Bypassing orthogonalization in
the quantum DPP sampler]()

by [Michaël Fanuel](https://mrfanuel.github.io/) and [Rémi Bardenet](https://rbardenet.github.io/).

We use Clifford loaders which are defined by [Kerenidis and Prakash](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00054).
